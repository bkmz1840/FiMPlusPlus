Dear Princess Celestia: An example letter.

    I learned random with a number.
        Then you get 42!
    That's all random!

    I learned get next index with a number using a number last index.
        Then you get last index plus 1.
    That's all get next index.

    I learned summator with a number using a number X and a number Y.
        Then you get X added to Y!
    That's all summator!

    I learned get flag with a argument.
        Then you get false!
    That's all get flag.

    I learned get default name with a name.
        Then you get "Ivan"!
    That's all get default name.

    I learned about greetings.
        I said "Hello!".
    That's all about greetings.

    Today I learned very much new.
        I thought "It's text for tests".
    That's all very much new!

Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
