Dear Princess Celestia: An example letter.

    Today I learned about switch.
        I asked x "How much?".
        In regards to x:
            On the 1st hoof:
                I said "One!".
            On the 2nd hoof:
                I said "Two!".
            On the 3rd hoof:
                I said "Three!".
            If all else fails:
                I said x.
        That's what I did.
    That's all about switch!

Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
