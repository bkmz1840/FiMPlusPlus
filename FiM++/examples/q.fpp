Dear Princess Celestia: An example letter.

    Today I learned very much new.
        Did you know that A has many numbers?
        For every number i from 1 to 10:
            A i is now i.
        That's what I did.
        For every number e in A:
            I wrote e.
        That's what I did.
    That's all very much new!

Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
