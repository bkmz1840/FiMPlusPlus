Dear Princess Celestia: An example letter.

I learned how greetings using the name Name.
    I said "Hello, " plus Name added to "!".
That's all how greetings!

Today I learned very much new.
    I asked Name "What is your name?". I remember how greetings using Name.
That's all very much new!

Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
