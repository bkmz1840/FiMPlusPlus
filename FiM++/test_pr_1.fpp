Dear Princess Celestia: An example letter.

    I learned how use conditional.
        If correct: I said "YES!".
    That's all how use conditional.

    I learned other conditional.
        Or else: I said "You can do this!".
    That's all other conditional.

    I learned how use several conditionals.
        If 4 is 5:
            I wrote "A".
        Or else:
            I wrote "B".
        Otherwise:
            I wrote "C".
        That's what I would do!
    That's all how use several conditionals.

    I learned about loops.
        For every character c from 'a' to 'z':
            I wrote c.
    That's all about loops.

    I learned about switch.
        Did you know that x is the number 0?
        In regards to x:
            On the 1st hoof:
                I said "Not zero!".
    That's all about switch.

Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
